💥 Gearblock SMP – Reborn After the Purge 💀
“Fuck off hackers.” – Gearblock, 2026
⚡ What Happened?

A massive unified purge event hit the server —
thanks to an absolute gremlin of a hacker who decided touching grass was optional.

✔ The good news

💾 We rolled the world back to a backup

🛡 Players didn’t lose their stuff (mostly)

(shoutout to the real ones)
